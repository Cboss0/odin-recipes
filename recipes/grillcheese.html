    <p>A simple staple that will teach all the fundementals needed
      to begin your cooking journey.  While only using few ingredients
      it requires careful preperation and knowledge of pan 
      tempeture and timings. So even if it seems simple take your time
      and you will be rewarded with a perfect result.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Two Pieces of Sliced Bread</li>
      <li>One Cup of Shredded Soft Cheese</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preperation and Cooking</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><p>First lets make sure your butter is softened,
        it is best to leave it covered until it is at room temperature
        until it's soft and spreadable.</p></li>
        <li><p>Then we must grate our cheese, pre package mild
          chedder or if you buy a block finely grate about one cup.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Now lets heat our pan on low medium heat. This is the
          going to be the most delicate part. We need the pan hot enough
          to start toasting the bread and melting the cheese but if 
          to hot it will burn the butter without melting the cheese.  And
          the vis versa to cold and it will turn the bread soggy. If you have
          a thermometer on hand try and maintain the pan at 250F.</p></li>
          <li><p>While the pan is heating it's time to organize and assemble
            our sandwhich. Butter generiously both pieces of bread on one side and in 
            a empty space on the stovetop next to the pan (BUT AWAY FROM THE
            BURNER) get your bread and cheese ready.</p>
            <li><p>Now is the time to cook. Once the pan is at temperature
              we are going to assemble the sandwhich inside the pan. Lets be quick
              but also accurate.  Dropping cheese into the hot pan will burn and make
              it very smelly!  Put one of the slices butter side down, then carefully spread
              the cheese on that slice and then finally cover the cheese with the 
              remaining slice butter side up.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Now be patient and let the bottom slice crisp up and the 
              cheese get gooey. Check after a min by using a spatula and gently
              lifting the bottom slightly up and checking the toast status.  Once
              the bottom is crispy golden brown.  We will flip the the sandwhich but
              this requires some careful considerations.  The cheese should have created
              a bond inside so it won't spill out on flip but we still need to be
              alittle careful as to not split the sandwhich into pieces.  Once you flipped
              let the now bottom side get crispy golden brown.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Now the best part, remove from pan and place on a plate! Cut
              threw the center at an angle or straight pull apart and enjoy!
            </p></li>
          
    </ol>
