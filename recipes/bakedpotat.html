    <p>So somebody is trying to teach the youths that microwaving
      and eating a potatoe raw is ok.  So lets just learn how to 
      properly bake in an oven the most basic of potatoe.
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Medium Russet Potatoe</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Prep and Cook</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Set the oven to 400F and get a baking pan out line
          with foil or oven safe parchment paper.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Take the potatoe, with a fork deeply stab 3 or more times
          in different locations making sure to atleast penetrate to the core.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Coat potatoe in oil and rub salt into skin</p></li>
        <li><p>Place potatoe on baking pan and place on the middle rack of 
          the oven.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Kick back and wait. Depending on the size of the potatoe
          it should take 30-1hr to fully cook.  Easy way to check is after 30-40
          min with the fork stab into potatoe, when it gives no resistance all the way
          it is finished.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>When potatoe is soft remove from oven and with your hands
          push down on both sides of the potatoe splitting it open.  Add Butter
          salt and pepper and enjoy.
        </p></li>
      </ol>
