    <p>Sorry this is going to be lazy making really good marinara and 
      meatballs is alot of work and I just want to get this assigment
      done. So we will be using pre made everything but pasta. It will
      still be good and to be honest learning al dente noodles is the 
      first real step so not all will be wasted.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Preggo Marinara Sauce</li>
        <li>Barillo Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Store Pre cooked meatballs</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><p>First we need a large pot and a medium sauce pan. Fill
          the large pot to just above half full with water and set burner
          to high.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Then in the medium sauce pan fill 3/4 full of preggo sauce
          and set burner to low medium. With the intent to start a light simmer
          on the sauce.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>When the water comes to a boil add a tablespoon of salt to
          the water then take 300g of spaghetti and drop in.  Using a pair
          of tongs stir and twist the spaghetti until it's fully submerged.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>When sauce is simmering, add pre cooked meatballs and let them
          soak in the sauce. Don't let it "boil".
        </p></li>
        <li><p>After about 10mins of boiling the spaghetti take a strand 
          out with a fork and taste test it.  We want the noodle to have no 
          crunch or resistance, keep testing the noodle until it bites soft.
          This usually takes 10-15min depending on elevation and noodle thickness.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>When the spaghetti is ready pour threw a strainer to drain 
          all the water and place on plate or bowl.  Then scoop meatballs out of
          sauce and place on noodles.  Add sauce untli lightly coating all noodle.
        </p></li>

      </ol>
